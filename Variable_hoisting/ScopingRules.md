# Scoping Rules
Variable declared by `let` have their scope in the block for which they are declared, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, `let` works very much like `var`. The main difference is that the scope of a `var` variable is the entire enclosing function:

```
function varTest(){
  var x = 1;
  {
    var x = 2; // same variable
    console.log(x); // 2
  }
  console.log(x); // 2
}

function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  {
    let x = 2; // different variable
    console.log(x); // 2
  }
  console.log(x); // 1
}
```
