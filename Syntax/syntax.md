## Basics
- Javascript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.


- Javascript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Fr端h (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.

`const fr端h = "foobar";`

- But, the variable `fr端h` is not the same as `Fr端h` because JavaScript is case sensitive.

- In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).


- The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)



## Commetns
- **The Syntax of __comments__ is the same as in C++ and in many other languages;

```// a one line comment```
